# Introduction to Arrays

## AddFives Project

This project consists of adding 5 units to each element of the specified array. This project may seem simple, but it's very beneficial to improve the way how to think about making some code in VBA.

Our mission is to convert the first array (from image 1) to the second array (from image 2)
