# Introduction to Arrays

## AddFives Project

In this project consists of adding 5 units to each element of the specified array. This project may seem simple, but it's very beneficial to improve the way how to think about making some code in VBA.

Our mission is to convert the first array (from image 1) to the second array (from image 2)

## AddFives_Alt Project

This project is similar to the AddFives Project, but the difference is that the new matrix that was generated will be in a different position.  

In other words, our mission is to generate a new array (as the image 2), add 5 units to each element of the original array (from image 1), and move it to another place different from the original array.
